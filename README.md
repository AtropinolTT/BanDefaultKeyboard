# BanDefaultKeyboard
Ban your Windows laptop keyboard with ONLY one click, significantly more elegantly than alternative methods.

---
   Hey, guys! Have you ever experienced some awkward moments, when you want to put your mechanical keyboard on your windows laptop, and find the size doesn't match ruining the whole typing experience or even force you to move your keyboard to other part of the desk? Yes, it's awful. And what make it worse, when you want to change the Windows setting to ban the default keyboard, the existing options always ask you to open control panel balabala or just type some not so practical commend lines. 
   WHY is it so complex? ALL I WANT is just a button to disable the keyboard for the moment! It can be solved by a simple bat script! What are you doing , microsoft?  
   Because they won't do it for me, so I self-taught myself how to write the bat script, and upload it here, it's not perfect, but at least it is serviceable. And to make it looks better, I designed an icon myself , hoping someday I can make it a better one, maybe an small app, make it more user friendly and can be installed more elegantly. It's just a bat, so basicly you can put it anywhere.  
   Personally, I recommend you to put these files in a non-system diskï¼Œ and just put the .ink file in the startup menu where the .ink files of your other softwares are.
